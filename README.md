## How to Run the Server App

To run the server app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/foobar_server.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd foobar_server
```

3. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

4. Start the server:

```
npm start
```

## Note

- Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running locally on port 27017.
- The server initializes the database with 25 posts and 4 users by default. The users are named "shlomi", "yael", "roni", and "evya". Shlomi is friends with all other users. The password for all users is "Zx123456789".
- Posts are ordered by date, with the newest posts appearing first.
- If you prefer not to add the default posts to the database, you can comment out the following code block in `app.js`:

```javascript
try {
    await User.insertMany(usersData);
    await Post.insertMany(postsData);
} catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
}
```
